			<p>This is an ongoing project.</p>
			<p>
				Advisor Experience is Orion’s solution for an all-in-one wealth management platform for
				financial advisors, assistants, operations officers, and various other financial user types.
				The goal of this project is to bridge gaps and create seamless workflows between all of our
				applications.
			</p>
			<p>
				This project started mid 2023 with the original intention of improving Redtail’s CRM
				application. However, as research progressed, we realized there were a lot of opportunities
				to improve the CRM using data that Orion could provide. With new intentions in mind, we
				started doing surveys, user interviews, and competitive analysis to determine core
				functionality required for this app to be successful.

			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>
				So many interviews. We wanted to get broad strokes on the page, determining where users were
				finding the most success and the most frustration in the system. It was also important to
				get a variety of user types, including assistants, operations officers, database managers,
				and financial advisors.
