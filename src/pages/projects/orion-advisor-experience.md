## Project Description
Advisor Experience is Orion’s solution for an all-in-one wealth management platform for financial advisors, assistants, operations officers, and various other financial user types. The goal of this project is to bridge gaps and create seamless workflows between all of our applications.

This project started mid 2023 with the original intention of improving Redtail’s CRM
application. However, as research progressed, we realized there were a lot of opportunities
to improve the CRM using data that Orion could provide. With new intentions in mind, we
started doing surveys, user interviews, and competitive analysis to determine core
functionality required for this app to be successful.

## Research
So many interviews. We wanted to get broad strokes on the page, determining where users were
finding the most success and the most frustration in the system. It was also important to
get a variety of user types, including assistants, operations officers, database managers,
and financial advisors.
